Review my current staged and unstaged changes (`git diff`).
Based on the specific components or logic I modified, create a "Conventional Commit" message (e.g., `feat(ui): add cover art component` or `fix(mobile): correct table spacing`).

1. **Stage** all changes.
2. **Commit** with that semantic message.
3. **Output** the commit hash and message so I know it's safe.

If the changes are too messy (mixing features and fixes), ask me for a summary first. Otherwise, just execute.
